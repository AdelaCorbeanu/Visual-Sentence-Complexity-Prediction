# Visual-Sentence-Complexity-Prediction
Machine learning solution for predicting the visual complexity of a sentence: K-Nearest-Neighbours and Support-Vector-Regression. This solution comes in response to this task: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vscp-pml-unibuc-2024 

### Brief description
Visual complexity refers to an image and it measures how elaborate it is, how much it stimulates the observer, etc. The current task provides short sentences describing images, which need to receive a score inside [-1;2] indicating the visual complexity of each image.

The solutions presented are based on two models: K-Nearest-Neighbours and Support-Vector-Regressor.
